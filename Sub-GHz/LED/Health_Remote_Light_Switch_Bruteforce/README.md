This is a collection of simple RAW captures of all the codes from the Health/Zenith Remote Light Switch.  You should be able to add these into a playlist or concatenate them together in a fancy way to make a simple bruteforcer.

The raw captures are separated into groups of On presses, and Off presses, for your convenience.

NOTE: I've tested these on two different styles of Heath receivers. You may need to adjust between 315mhz and 310mhz for your particular receiver.  Some seem to work better with one or the other.
