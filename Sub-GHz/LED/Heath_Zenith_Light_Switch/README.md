Full capture of Heath/Zenith remote light switch.

This system operates on a Holtek_HT12X 12 bit static code on 315Mhz

The options for the light are:
Dim (ends with 2)
On (ends with 1)
Off (ends with 0)

The remote and the receiver are paired using DIP switches. As it turns out, the number 4 DIP switch is ignored. For example, DIP 1110 is the same as DIP 1111. 

The sub files are named by the value that is transmitted.
