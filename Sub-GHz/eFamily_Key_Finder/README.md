These are captures from the remote for an eFamily key locator set.  

#Usage

1.) Turn a tag on.  It will continuously make long beep sounds.
2.) Using the Flipper, play the corresponding signal you want to program into the tag (ie, Tag1.sub gets played for the tag with the number 1)
3.) After the first play, the tag should be programmed to respond to that signal. After a brief moment, the tag should emit a series of repeating beeps when the signal is played back from the Flipper.

These captures may work on other, similar key locators, but it has not been tested.
