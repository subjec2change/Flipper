Two scripts to perform the utilman.exe -> cmd.exe trick when using a Windows boot media.

Part 1 is to be used while booted from the USB media. Run it at the Install screen.

Part 2 is used after utilman.exe has been renamed, and is used to create a new admin account at the login screen, 
utilizing the utilman.exe switcheroo set up in Part 1.

Note, this trick will not work if Bitlocker is enabled.
