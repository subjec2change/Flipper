REM example code to demonstrate BadUSB powershell waiting for Flipper disk image to mount after execution
REM Powershell will wait until a device with the specified drive label is found.
REM When drive label is mounted, Powershell will copy a payload.txt from the disk image to current user's desktop and open it.
REM disk image in Flipper must have the drive label: flipdisk

REM Open Powershell
DELAY 500
GUI r
DELAY 500

STRING powershell

DELAY 500
ENTER
DELAY 750

REM $d is the powershell command to run once the flipper disk image is found
STRING $d={$Desktoppath=[environment]::getfolderpath("desktop"); cp $driveLetter\payload.txt $desktoppath\payload.txt;invoke-item $desktoppath\payload.txt;};

REM below is the powershell stager to look for a disk label called 'flipdisk'. 
REM Powershell will remain open and wait until it sees the disk mount.
REM Once disk is found, command $d from above is executed.
STRING Register-WmiEvent -Class win32_VolumeChangeEvent -SourceIdentifier volumeChange;do{$newEvent = Wait-Event -SourceIdentifier volumeChange;$eventType = $newEvent.SourceEventArgs.NewEvent.EventType;if ($eventType -eq 2){$driveLetter = $newEvent.SourceEventArgs.NewEvent.DriveName;$driveLabel = ([wmi]"Win32_LogicalDisk='$driveLetter'").VolumeName;if ($driveLabel -eq 'flipdisk'){start-sleep -seconds 1;& $d;exit;}};Remove-Event -SourceIdentifier volumeChange;} while (1-eq1);Unregister-Event -SourceIdentifier volumeChange
