Demo of using PopOS 22.04 GUI to exfiltrate the passphrase of the first wifi connection present in network manager. Uses a webhook.

This is done primarily via GUI to avoid needing sudo trying to extract the data using the terminal.

Replace <YOUR WEBHOOK HERE> with your own appropriate webhook to capture the data.
  
Adjust timings as needed. This is purely a proof-of-concept.

IT ONLY EXTRACTS THE PASSPHRASE, NOT THE SSID
