## Reporting a Vulnerability or Issue

If you have found a vulnerability or issue with one of the files on my repo, you should reach out to the creator.
Though many of the files within this repo I did not make, I may be able to assist with contacting who did.
If you have found an error in one of the descriptions, or ReadMe's, then please [open an issue](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/issues) for assistance.

Though I may not be as active as I was previously, I still monitor and try to maintain Poul requests and issues.
If something is critical, then you can try and find me on discord or reach out to someone that may be able to reach me.
